		<div class="aboutus">
			<p class="lead">Space Concordia is an award-winning, multidisciplinary student society of over 200 students from various fields of study working in different subdivisions such as Spacecraft, Ground Station, Rocketry and Robotics. The society’s mission is twofold:<br></p>
			<ul class="lead"><li>First, to provide students with opportunities to participate in space-related projects and competitions.</li>
				<li>Second, to promote the learning and application of space engineering within Concordia University and various educational institutions around Montreal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="lead">Space Concordia does continuous effort to be more than just your average student society with a typical competition-based structure, but instead something similar to a mini space agency, where we show our expertise not only through in the projects we develop, but also in the actions we do in the larger scale to benefit society as a whole.</p>

				<h2 class="featurette-heading">History</h2>
				<h3 class="subfeaturette-heading"><span class="text-muted">2010-2011</span></h3>
				<p class="lead">This division came in existence as a result of a big capstone project. Over the course of a year, we designed and built a rover for the University Rover Competition in Utah. The rover is supposed to function in a simulated Mars environment. The Robotics Division also gets to work on other robotic projects. This year, we're planning to send a team to IEEE's RoboWars competition. It has 4 subteams: Software, Power, Electrical, and Mechanical.</p>

				<hr class="featurette-divider">

				<h3 class="subfeaturette-heading"><span class="text-muted">2012</span></h3>
				<p class="lead">It was a long road for the group of students, but in May 2012, the competition reached its end. Only a handful of the initial Canadian Universities were able to complete their satellite for the final stages of CSDC. After a series of functional demonstrations and an environmental test, Space Concordia had been awarded 1st place in all of Canada!<br><br>

					The Consat-1 team used the victory to found Space Concoria. The momentum gained from this competition has enabled the team to create the Ground Segment of Space Concordia. Alongside this, the Rocketry Division and Robotics Division have been created under the same student society. As such, a governing council was established and a huge reorganization ensued. 2012 marks the year Space Concordia had transformed into a multi-competition and multi-project student society.<br><br>

					The newly established Spacecraft Division has then voted on competing once again in the next iteration of CSDC with a new satellite: Consat-2.</p>

					<hr class="featurette-divider">

					<h3 class="subfeaturette-heading"><span class="text-muted">2013</span></h3>
					<p class="lead">The Consat-2 team was composed of an entirely new set of members, all eager to follow the footsteps of their predecessors. Finding it difficult to collect funding for their project, the team turned to Kickstarter. The campaign was a great success, and the team was able to collect more than 15,000$ in donations. As a result of this campaign, the Consat-2 satellite has been renamed Aleksandr in honor of the deceased father of our most generous supporter.</p>

					<hr class="featurette-divider">

					<h3 class="subfeaturette-heading"><span class="text-muted">2014</span></h3>
					<p class="lead">Once again, the team has returned to the final environmental test phase of CSDC with the Aleksandr satellite. The team was more than ready to present the result of their effort, and was graciously awarded 2nd place in all of Canada, with University of Victoria awarded as winner of CSDC. Space Concordia was once again at the podium of CSDC.<br><br>

						For the next iteration of CSDC, the team has decided to keep working on Aleksandr and improve the current design. With a new set of members, the new team is ambitious and determined to achieve 1st place in the next CSDC.<br><br>

						2014 also marked the first entry of Space Concordia’s Rocketry Division in the International Rocketry Engineering Competition (IREC).</p>

						<p class="lead">Space Concordia is dedicated not only to building projects, but also to introducing the public to space. We love to share our knowledge and experience to different spheres of society. We present to multiple areas, from the local elementary school to the IAC international congress.<br><br>

							The Space field already has a widely appreciated appeal, and is generally respected by the public. What Space Concordia attempts to show is the fact that not only is Space interesting, but that it is also very accessible, may it be through a career or simply a hobby. Space Concordia aims to inspire people to go the extra step and explore the many possibilities of today’s technology and wonder about the unknowns of space.<br><br>

							Through their numerous outreach activities, the team wishes to not only provide their audience with general knowledge of space, but also with the intent to pursue those interests in a concrete manner. This is especially the case for their younger audience.</p>
